#Pi Portals
The Pi website has been designed with the future in mind. Each section of the site will have its own portal, but they'll be designed with each other in mind. This will make it easier to move around the site and become familiar with what to expect where and how to do each type of thing.

The URL structure is an good example of this approach. The first portal launched was for blogs, so 1.3142.xyz. But each language needs its own subdomain, so we've used en.1.3142.xyz for English and es.1.3142.xyz for Spanish. Each language can grow at its own rate, much like the pages on Wikipedia do.

###Clowie's Corner
####A Pyrenean Mountain Dog's perspective by Clowie the Dog
![Clowie Cameo](http://res.cloudinary.com/pi/image/upload/v1462098948/ClowieCameo_rxwooa.png)

Clowie's adventures are always entertaining and she also writes informative posts. Her most popular post is [To bark, or not to bark, that is the question](http://clowiescorner.en.1.3142.xyz/to-bark-or-not-to-bark-that-is-the-question/) which gives her views on managing the vocal tendencies of a Pyrenean Mountain Dog (Great Pyrenees).

On a lighter note, her tale about her first encounter with a [kissing gate](http://clowiescorner.en.1.3142.xyz/the-kissing-gate/) has also proved popular. When she turned her sleuthing talents to the question [Who was William Shakespeare?](http://clowiescorner.en.1.3142.xyz/who-was-william-shakespeare/) the results were surprising, to say the least!

Clowie's latest post is [My Calendar](http://clowiescorner.en.1.3142.xyz/my-calendar/).

Richard may not write posts very often, but when he does they're well worth the wait. 

Here's Richard's latest post [Value Objects and Immutability](http://richardmiller.en.1.3142.xyz/2014/11/21/value-objects-and-immutability/).
