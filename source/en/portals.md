#Pi Portals
The Pi website has been designed with the future in mind. Each section of the site will have its own portal, but they'll be designed with each other in mind. This will make it easier to move around the site and become familiar with what to expect where and how to do each type of thing.

The URL structure is a good example of this approach. The first portal launched was for blogs, so 1.3142.xyz. But each language needs its own subdomain, so we've used en.1.3142.xyz for English and es.1.3142.xyz for Spanish. Each language can grow at its own rate, much like the pages on Wikipedia do.

Audiodog wites a mixture of [technical posts](http://audiodog.en.1.3142.xyz/category/tech/) and [personal posts](http://audiodog.en.1.3142.xyz/category/personal/) all of which are fun and informative.

Audiodog's latest personal post is [Logik LBFANX12 electric oven not heating up](http://audiodog.en.1.3142.xyz/logik-lbfanx12-electric-oven-not-heating-up/), while his latest tech post is [Engineers need to keep in time too!](http://audiodog.en.1.3142.xyz/engineers-need-to-keep-in-time-too/). 

###Clowie's Corner
####A Pyrenean Mountain Dog's perspective

Clowie's adventures are always entertaining and she also writes informative posts. Her most popular post is [To bark, or not to bark, that is the question](http://clowiescorner.en.1.3142.xyz/to-bark-or-not-to-bark-that-is-the-question/) which gives her views on managing the vocal tendencies of a Pyrenean Mountain Dog (Great Pyrenees).

On a lighter note, her tale about her first encounter with a [kissing gate](http://clowiescorner.en.1.3142.xyz/the-kissing-gate/) has also proved popular. When she turned her sleuthing talents to the question [Who was William Shakespeare?](http://clowiescorner.en.1.3142.xyz/who-was-william-shakespeare/) the results were surprising, to say the least!

Clowie's latest post is [My Calendar](http://clowiescorner.en.1.3142.xyz/my-calendar/).
