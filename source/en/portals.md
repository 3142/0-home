#Pi Portals
The Pi website has been designed with the future in mind. Each section of the site will have its own portal, but they'll be designed with each other in mind. This will make it easier to move around the site and become familiar with what to expect where and how to do each type of thing.

The URL structure is an good example of this approach. The first portal launched was for blogs, so 1.3142.xyz. But each language needs its own subdomain, so we've used en.1.3142.xyz for English and es.1.3142.xyz for Spanish. Each language can grow at its own rate, much like the pages on Wikipedia do.
