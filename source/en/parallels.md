# Parallels

## Overview

The original and translated text are presented in a choice of formats. The preference of format may vary with the level of the reader.

## Original text

The complete original

## Complete translation

A complete translation without the original.

## Parallel text

The original text and the translation are displayed side by side, in parallel. This works well on a large screen and makes it easy to reference both languages.

## Mixed

One paragraph of the original text appears followed by one paragraph of the translation. This works well on a smaller screen and still makes it easy to refer to the other language.

## Hidden translation

The original text appears with a + sign to press if a translation is required for that paragraph.

## Compact

The original text and the translation are displayed in a compact format, making this ideal for viewing on a small screen.
