#All About Pi
At Pi we're all about quality and fun. We're aiming to build a website that provides a reliable, easy to use resource that's also enjoyable to be on. For example, that means choosing blog authors who take a pride in their posts. This may mean that they don't write posts as often as some, but it does mean that their posts are worth the wait. They all include a mixture of the informative with a touch of humour. An approach we enjoy and hope you will too.
